		 * 1. reserve <name> – inputs the name of a person and reserves a seat against this name. If the theater does not
	have enough seats(completely booked), no seat is assigned and the command responds with message: ‘Sold out -
	No seat available’. If a reservation has already been made under that name, then the command responds with
	message: ‘Seat already booked against the name provided’.
	Otherwise, a seat is reserved against the name provided and the client is relayed a message: ‘Seat assigned to you
	is <seat-number>’.
	2. bookSeat <name> <seatNum> – behaves similar to reserve command, but imposes an additional constraint that
	a seat is reserved if and only if there is no existing reservation against name and the seat having the number seatNum
	is available. If there is no existing reservation but seatNum is not available, the response is: ‘<seatNum> is not
	available’.
	3. search <name> – returns the seat number reserved for name. If no reservation is found for name the system responds
	with a message: ‘No reservation found for <name>’.
	4. delete <name> – frees up the seat allocated to that person. The command returns the seat number that was
	released. If no existing reservation was found, responds with: ‘No reservation found for <name>’.
	Here <text> is used to indicate the value of the parameter denoted by text in the given context. Note that you
	also have to write the client program that takes input from the user and then communicates with a server using sockets.
	Your program should behave correctly in presence of multiple concurrent clients.
